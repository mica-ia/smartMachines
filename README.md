## What is this?
Smart Machines is a class being run through the Interactive Arts department at the Maryland Institute College of Art (or MICA). In this class, we are all exploring artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the application of both to art making and beyond.

In this repository, we aim to share our experience as a new class, a crash course guide on how to work with artificial intelligence, our work, and our thoughts and feelings on the usage of artificial intelligence in the modern world.

This is still very much in progress, but for now, check out our crash course into terminals, Python, and AI/machine learning!
